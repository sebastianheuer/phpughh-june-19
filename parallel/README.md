# Asynchronous PHP with the Parallel Extension Example Code

This code was used to showcase the [PHP Parallel Extension](https://github.com/krakjoe/parallel) by Joe Watkins. 

## Usage

Run `docker-compose exec php-zts php /app/calculate.php <numberOfTasks>` to run the command with the given number of parallel tasks. (Make sure your terminal window is large enough so all progress bars fit in, otherwise you'll get broken output).
